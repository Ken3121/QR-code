## My process
Used flexbox to center the divs, chose to use px for the width and height of card as I did not want the card to change size when browser window size is changed.


### Built with

- basic CSS and HTML
- Flexbox
- google fonts

### What I learned

Maybe finally starting to get the hang of GitHub basics.
Learnt how to use google fonts and create that link in the html:
 <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"> 



### Continued development

I would still like work on accessibility and getting the sizing right. In my second uploaded version, I tried to get the sizing a bit closer to the design.
